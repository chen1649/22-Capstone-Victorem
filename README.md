# What is Pawdy?

Pawdy is a free pet sitting service exchange website designed for UW students. We hope to help student pet owners find pet sitting services they need, which can also help students build community as pet owners. For more information regarding Pawdy, check our landing page [here](). Currently, Pawdy is only focused on the University of Washington campus, but can be easily transitioned to other Universities.
